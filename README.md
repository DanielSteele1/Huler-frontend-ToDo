# Front End Developer Technical Challenge - Daniel Steele's Submission

### **Tasks Completed:**

- Add a new task
- Saved task into localStorage so when the user reloads the app, thier tasks save.
- Align app with design as accurately as possible
- Mark a todo as completed by checking it - task text also gets crossed out.
- Added responsive styling so app works on all viewports.

### **Tasks In progress:**

- Drag and Drop functionality - users can reorder tasks - however this feature doesnt work as expected yet. when a task is dragged, instead of dropping in the expected position, the task will default to the bottom of the list.

### **Tasks put on hold/not attempted**

- subtasks - basic structure was attempted however put on hold due to drag and drop taking more time to implement than expected.
### **To run**
first - run npm install - I've installed DnD-kit for example.
then, once inside the frontend-challenge-code folder, type:

npm run dev
